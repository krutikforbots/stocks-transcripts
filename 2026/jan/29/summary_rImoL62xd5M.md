Kevin anchors his warning on newly released private-credit dashboards that, in his view, confirm the artificial-intelligence boom and the shadow-bank lending that financed it are entering a feedback loop headed in the wrong direction. He notes that Microsoft’s 10% single-session plunge—“something you would really only find during like a COVID crash”—dragged the entire software stack lower because institutional investors suddenly questioned how much of the company’s future growth depends on a very narrow AI partner set. The remaining-performance-obligation figure Microsoft touted ($625 billion) is, per Kevin, 40% tied to OpenAI, a start-up he says is still years away from profitability and is burning tens of billions annually. If OpenAI struggles to keep raising cash, Microsoft faces both concentration risk and renewal risk as 2026–2027 Copilot contracts come up in an environment where roughly two-thirds of surveyed firms report “no change” in productivity from AI.
